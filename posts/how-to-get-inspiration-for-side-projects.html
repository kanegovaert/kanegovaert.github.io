  Side projects are a fun way to spend quality time with your coding skills. But it’s so hard to get good side projects. Everybody has already done everything so why even bother? Well, why not? It doesn’t matter that people have already wrote certain projects. As long as you’re having fun and are improving upon your coding skills it doesn’t matter. But how do you find new side projects? Let’s answer that question right now.<br><br>
I have always struggled with finding side projects. But one thing I always do is look at <a href="https://reddit.com/r/coolgithubprojects">/r/coolgithubprojects</a> and check what they have been doing. You find the most creative projects there. You can either contribute or think of a better version. <br><br>
What’s also fun is building bots. Especially for social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit. You can easily find an API and start automating stuff like following people, retweeting, commenting, and more but do remember to respect every website their ToS and read their API limits. 
Furthermore just automate that boring task you have to do every day with a simple script. I always wanted to know immediately what grade I had like as soon as possible so instead of logging in to my school website every time I wrote a simple script that checks incoming grades and notifies me. 
<br><br>
And if you're really desperate you can always contribute to other projects. For instance the Linux kernel. I was bored and made my first contribution ever to the Linux kernel a while ago. 
    <br><br>
    So good luck with finding side projects. And if you still haven't found a solution just read my blog for the rest of the day!<br><br>- Kane Govaert
