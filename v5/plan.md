## Kane Govaert version 5
The fifth version of this website is coming along. In this version I'd like to emotionally manipulate my audience with the use of colors and verbal communication.

What kind of emotions do I want to bring forward:
- Trust
- Happiness
- Motivation
- Creativity

First, which colors have an correlation with certain emotions:

Red: Anger, embarrassment, passionate, and lustful.
Blue: Shyness, sadness, and calmness.
Yellow: Cowardice, happiness, or caution.
Green: Disgust, envy, sickness, friendly, or greedy.
Grey: Depression and emotionless.
Black: Cold or mournful.
Pink: Cheery, embarrassed, and love.
White: Sick, shocked, scared, cold, and mournful.

I'll be using the colors:
Yellow: For it's happiness property
